# puts adds a line break

puts "hello world"
puts "i am doing great thanks"

# print does not

print "hello"
print "world"

# these are statements
# rubyists do not add semicolon after a statements

puts "i can do this";
print "but rubyists do not"

puts "but i can do this"; print "which i guess is kinda neat"

# best practice is one statement per line

puts 5
puts 5+5
puts 1.3+5
print 3+5*5
puts
# puts "5"+5

# this is fun
# concatenation

puts "cool" + "beans"

puts "
this
also
does
work
